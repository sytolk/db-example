# db-node-plugin-example

Example usage of Sqlite template to build Server side Linux Windows fermat node app.

This node app will be installed on Linux Server that have a public IP address.

**To developing fermat-node app for Android platform:**
For Android there's no reason why you couldn't set up a fermat-node server behind NAT and use on router port forwarding (DMZ host) to make it public, but it would be a very strange way to set things up..
Mobile devices don\`t have wire connected they move from WiFi to 3G 4G networks all behind PAT(Port Address Translation) and NAT(Network Address Translation) and the problem is that they don\`t have a public IP address.
